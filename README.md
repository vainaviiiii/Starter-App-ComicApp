Using what I had learnt from the 'Introduction to Information Systems & Programming' Course, I had designed a Starter App to download Comic Strips.

Main Objective of the starter app:
1. User enters a number from 1 to the latest xkcd comic number and clicks 'Get Comic'.
2. The Comic and its URL is displayed.
